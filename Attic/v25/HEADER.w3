<h1>V25 cross-compiler</h1>

This directory contains cross-compiler code for the NEC V25, an 8086-like
processor with a few architectural extensions. Its instruction set is
almost identical to the 80186, but the interrupt and I/O design is very
different.

I'm using this code right now on a particular project; so, while remaining
idiosyncratic, it should -very soon- become useful.

(Many more comments to come.)
