muforth README
==============

Sadly, there isn't an up-to-date README about the current indirect-threaded
implementation of muforth.

For now you can read the old, obsolete README (now in doc/README.obsolete)
which documents the original form of muforth: a simple subroutine-threaded (ie,
native) Forth with a tiny built-in x86 compiler. While attempting to port this
version of muforth to the PowerPC I ran into trouble and decided that a
traditional threaded Forth might be a better choice.

Many, but not all, of the concepts in the original README still apply, so
skimming thru it wouldn't necessarily be a waste of time. ;-)

Stay tuned for a real, up-to-date README.
