muFORTH README. 2003-sep-04.

Why muforth?
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Why write another Forth when there are so many around? Because
everyone else's Forth is wrong. ;-)

First of all, muforth is most emphatically _not_ ANS-compatible. It
would be silly to write another when there are perfectly good ones
available. I wanted instead to build a Forth with specific features,
several of which are shamelessly stolen from Chuck Moore's colorforth
(http://colorforth.com):

(a) a kernel, written in C, that is the smallest possible kernel
    capable of compiling Forth colon definitions (ie, it is self-
    bootstrapping);

(b) a simple native-code compiler;

(c) a tail-recursive implementation;

(d) a new parser, tokenizer, and interpreter

(e) colorforth's terseness but implemented without color and without
    reinventing the OS.

Oddities and idiosyncrasies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

muforth has several odd differences from more conventional (old-school?) Forths. Most of these differences result from the  from Forth (many stemming from the colorforth ideas)

- [ ] -]
- ; -; ^
- =if =while (non-destructive test)
- create/does>
- no smudge or similar
- nifty parser/tokenizer (text v. string type)
- non-inline strings
