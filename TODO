A new naming convention for routines, so there is less confusion about
whether a function expects to be called by C or Forth.

There are two possibilities:

(1) all Forth routines get "f_" or "mu_" or "rt_" (runtime) or "k_"
(kernel) or something like that prepended to their names.

(2) all C routines get "c_" or "glue_" or something like that
prepended to their names.

I'm not sure whether to aim for readability of the strings of
Forth-like routines in C code, or for the readability of the basic C
code.

I'm leaning towards prefixing the names of Forth words, since, in the
C kernel, they are the exceptions to the "normal" C calling
convention.
