design notes:

8 steppers (32 outputs)
8 dc motors ( 16 outputs )

16 latch lines to select motor limit switches
8 to select keyb cols (rows)
(scanned separately)

porta is input for keyb scanning.
portc is output for midi latch board (!)
disp uses 8 more latch lines (88-95?), decoded like a stepper

all 8 steppers are run up/run down till limit.
4 of the dc motors are like steppers; 4 are go till limit, switch
direction.

at first only the portC latches will be midi.
