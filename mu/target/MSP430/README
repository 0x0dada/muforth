Against my better judgment I've been convinced to write some target support
code for TI's MSP430 16-bit low-power microcontrollers.

I looked at these chips a long time ago and decided against them (and in favour
of Freescale's S08 8-bit MCUs) largely because of the dearth of MSP430 DIP
parts for prototyping. On the plus side, the architecture is quite nice - very
reminiscent of the PDP-11, my all-time favourite computer architecture - and
quite a good fit for Forth.

So, here goes...
