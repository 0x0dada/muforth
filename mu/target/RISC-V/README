This directory contains the sources for a RISC-V Forth meta-compiler.

Like any meta-compiler there are several parts to this:

  * a RISC-V assembler
  * a RISC-V disassembler
  * a meta-compiler that takes target assembler and Forth source code and
    "compiles" it to create a memory image
  * some kind of "tethering" connection, either over a serial line or a debug
    interface (eg, JTAG), that allows interactive coding and exploration

Initially I'm targeting the HiFive1 board from SiFive. This features an FE310
chip containing an RV32IMAC core As more cores, chips, and boards are released, I'll
try to follow along with support.
