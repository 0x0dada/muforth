Currently I've got several "firmware command loops" defined for the S08.

Except for the USB BDM code, which is too big to fit, each one takes one slot -
512 bytes of flash.

In the load-* files I use the word "fslot" to calculate the starting address
for me. If I'm compiling for a USB chip, and I'm not compiling the boot code, I
add one to the slot number.

Here is a map of what I have so far:

  Slot Start Len  What (serial)         What (USB)
  ==== ===== ===  =============         ==========
    0  fe00  200  Boot and debug        Boot and debug
    1  fc00  200  BDM                   BDM (cont'd)
    2  fa00  200  AVR programming code  BDM
    3  f800  200  IIC test              AVR programming code
    4  f600  200  IIC chat              IIC test
    5  f400  200  (nothing)             IIC chat
    6  f200  200  (nothing)             MIDI send/recv
